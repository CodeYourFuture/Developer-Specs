# How To Get Help

Learning to ask good questions is a key skill for a developer and you should practice this every week at CYF. You must spend a lot of time learning how to describe problems clearly and systematically:

https://curriculum.codeyourfuture.io/guides/asking-questions

Problem-solving is the real (marketable) skill of software developers. If you do not have questions to ask about your work, ask for some different work. Don't miss this opportunity to break down challenging problems with a large team of developers.

## Guide

First, write up your question as clearly as you can. This will help you to think through the problem and will usually help you to solve it yourself. If you still can't solve it, post your question to Slack. If you still can't solve it, come to class with your question.
